Windows Setup
============

## What is Windows Setup? ##

**Windows Setup** is a set of [Chocolatey ](http://chocolatey.org) scripts that help me setup new instances of Windows machines.

##How to use##
Fork or download this repo.  Examine the Normal.bat, Advanced.bat, and DevTools.bat files and remove programs you dont use and add the Programs You Loveâ„  from the [Chocolatey repo](https://chocolatey.org/packages). Then right click one of the ClickTo*.bat files and **Run As Administrator**.
